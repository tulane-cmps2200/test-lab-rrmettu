# Recitation Test

This is a test lab to make sure we can get the labs to work using github classroom and repl.it.

1. Accept the github classroom assignment invitation sent via Canvas.
  - be sure to login to github with the ID you gave in the survey
2. Point your browser to your github repository that was created for this assignment (e.g., for **me** this is<https://github.com/tulane-cmps2200/test-lab-aronwc>)
3. Launch the repl.it instance for this repository (you can click on the "Work in Repl.it" button in the README of your repository).
  - You may have to give repl.it permission to use your github account. This is how you are able to push to github via repl.it
  - This can sometimes take a minute. If it throws some error, try refreshing. I've had good luck with Chrome and Firefox. If it fails, try going back to your github account and click on repl.it again.
4. Implement the `sum_of_squares` function in `main.py`.
5. Confirm that the test passes by pressing the "play" button.
6. Add a new test function called `test_two` that gives some other test case and confirm it passes.
7. Push your code back to github by clicking the "Version Control" button in the left panel. See here <img src="https://codewithrepl.it/img/06-version-control-tab.png">
